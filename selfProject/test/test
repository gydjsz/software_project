Long, long ago, there was a king. Solomon was his name. He was very clever.In his country, there were two women. They lived in the same house and each had a child.

One night, one of the babies died. The dead baby’s mother took the other woman’s baby, and put it in her own bed.

The next morning , they had a quarrel.
“No, this is my baby!” The dead is yours!”
Each one wanted the living baby. So they went to see King Solomon.
“Bring me a knife, cut the child into two and five, each woman one half.” said the King.
“Oh. Your Majesty! Give her my baby. Please don’t kill my baby!”
Then King Solomon pointed to the woman in teas and said, “Give the baby to her. She is the mother.”

God had given Solomon any wish, and he chose wisdom. This I heard from another guard. Icouldn’t believe it! Why hadn’t he picked other things like riches, long life, or the death of his enemies? Now I know why because he is one of the youngest rulers ever and he needs wisdom to rule the people. God thought that it was such a good answer so he gave him wisdom, riches,power and fame.

When Pharaoh came to Jerusalem to speak with Solomon, I was called to stand behind KingSolomon. I was listening to their conversation when finally they came to a point. Solomon had made an alliance or a so-called treaty of peace by marrying Pharaoh’s daughter. I was at their wedding too. I soon overheard about how King Solomon was making a temple to the one and only God above. I was sent to work at the masonry, because I was once a stone mason and they are short of masons so they are pulling everybody with rock carving experience to them asonry. At least I don’t have to worked like those labour slaves have to. They are worked until they are almost dead. It looks like they never stop working. I feel that those labour.
